# BookDatabase
### Book Database

**Concepts:** Cloud Network Applications, Dynamic Web Development

**Software & Languages:** Apache Tomcat, HTML, CSS, Eclipse, Java, AWS

**Packages:** N/A

**Description:** This basic website was an assignment I worked on and created in a cloud network application and web development course at UGA. We were tasked with building a dynamic website mimicing a book database or online library. We used AWS S3 for cloud storage and other AWS products such as EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Console, and RDS It shows all of the books available in the database, giving to the option to add, edit, or delete books. I have included this project in my portfolio to get a glimpse of my past experiences with web development, but unfortunately, I have lost the correct software and connections to run and visualize the app.
